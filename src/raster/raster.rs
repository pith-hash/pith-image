//! The raw image buffer every decoder writes and every hash reads.
//!
//! [`Image`] is deliberately the smallest honest structure: a tight,
//! row-major, unpadded [`Vec`](alloc::vec::Vec) of samples plus `width`,
//! `height` and two marker parameters — the pixel [`Layout`] (`Gray`,
//! `Rgb`, `Rgba`) and the [`Sample`] type (`u8`, `u16`). Tight layout
//! means `stride == width * channels` is never stored and can never
//! disagree with the data; a padded buffer would need a stride field, a
//! stride argument on every constructor, and a policy for the tail bytes.
//!
//! An image is always well-formed: [`Image::new`] and [`Image::from_vec`]
//! refuse zero dimensions, wrap-around arithmetic and buffers larger than
//! [`MAX_BUFFER_BYTES`], so methods can index without re-checking.
