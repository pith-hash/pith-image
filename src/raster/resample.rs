//! Box-average resampling: the only resizer the kit needs.
//!
//! Output pixel `(x, y)` averages the axis-aligned source rectangle that
//! maps to it under integer floor boundaries — column `x` covers
//! `⌊x·W/W'⌋ .. ⌊(x+1)·W/W'⌋` and row `y` likewise. The boundaries are
//! the spec's accumulated-remainder rule made exact: box widths differ by
//! at most one source pixel and are fully determined by the four
//! dimensions, so two independent implementations bit-match.
//!
//! Each output sample is `round_half_up(mean)` of its box, computed
//! entirely in `u64` — `(2·sum + n) / (2·n)`. No fractional coefficients,
//! no float, one rounding step. A separable two-pass filter would round
//! twice and drift off the exact box mean; the one-pass form is both
//! simpler and exact, and `box_average(im, 1, 1)` is the exact mean of
//! the whole buffer.
//!
//! Upscaling is defined but not what the kit does: when a box is empty
//! (`out > in` on an axis), the pixel samples the nearest source point —
//! the box centre `⌊(2j+1)·in/(2·out)⌋`. Documented so the function is
//! total, not offered as a resampling feature.
