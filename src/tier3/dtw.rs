//! Dynamic time warping with a Sakoe–Chiba band — spec §4.3: *"chuỗi
//! đặc trưng 1D, dải Sakoe–Chiba `w = 10%`, O(n·w) — không O(n²)"*.
//!
//! [`dtw`] consumes an explicit `n×m` cost matrix (row-major) so the
//! crate stays metric-agnostic; [`dtw_series`] is the spec's 1-D
//! feature-string convenience wrapper using absolute distance.
//!
//! Two deviations from textbook DTW, both pinned by the reference
//! implementation (`hashkit/tier3.py:dtw_mean_cost`) because they were
//! measured to matter:
//!
//! * The answer is the **per-step mean** `D[n][m] / L[n][m]`, not the
//!   raw total — normalizing by the warping path's length stops longer
//!   paths from looking worse just for being longer.
//! * The band **centres on the diagonal mapped by length ratio**,
//!   `centre_i = i·m/n`, so unequal-length sequences still get a usable
//!   corridor. `width = max(2, band·max(n, m))` gives the spec's 10 %
//!   band a 2-cell floor that keeps tiny inputs reachable.
//! * A pair whose band makes `(n, m)` unreachable answers `1.0` — the
//!   maximum-meaningful cost — rather than an error: "this band rejects
//!   the alignment" is a legitimate DTW verdict, not malformed input.
//!
//! The DP needs only the previous row, so it keeps two `m+1` buffers and
//! runs in `O(n·w)` time and `O(m)` space.
