//! FAST-9 corner detection and steered-BRIEF (rBRIEF) descriptors — the
//! spec §4.3 ORB recipe in miniature: find corner pixels on a 16-pixel
//! circle, take a 31×31 patch, steer a fixed 256-pair test pattern by the
//! patch's intensity-centroid orientation, and emit a 256-bit descriptor.
//!
//! The pinned constants come from the design spec and the ORB paper
//! (Rublee et al., ICCV 2011):
//!
//! * [`FAST9_THRESHOLD`] = 20 — the circle-vs-centre contrast floor.
//! * [`FAST9_ARC`] = 9 — the minimum contiguous run of circle pixels
//!   beyond the threshold that makes a corner.
//! * [`PATCH_RADIUS`] = 15 — BRIEF's 31×31 patch, and the radius of the
//!   disk the 256 test pairs are generated inside. Because every pair
//!   offset satisfies `x² + y² ≤ 225`, rotating it by any angle keeps it
//!   inside the same disk: a 15-pixel border is sufficient for steered
//!   sampling (no patch padding beyond the nominal 31×31).
//! * [`BRIEF_SEED`] — the fixed splitmix64 seed the pair table is
//!   generated with. Any seed would do; this one is part of the format:
//!   descriptors are only comparable between runs of the same table.
//!
//! Orientations are measured in radians with
//! `θ = atan2(m01, m10)` over the full 31×31 patch (image moments,
//! OpenCV ORB convention), and the descriptor bit order is MSB-first
//! inside each byte, matching the kit's row-major/MSB-first bitpacking
//! convention.
//!
//! Hostile inputs cannot panic: descriptor requests that reach outside
//! the image return `None`, never index out of bounds.
